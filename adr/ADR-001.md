# ADR-01: New x/mint module.

## Abstract

We propose to replace the default cosmos-sdk `x/mint` module with an archway variation which inflates using block time
instead of using block numbers. In order to make inflation more linear and predictable. 

## Context

The default cosmos-sdk `x/mint` module creates an inflation stream based on the foreseen amount of blocks that there can
be in a single year. This is problematic, because the amounts of block in a year can change drastically based on the 
network's decentralisation. For example, initially the chain might have `1 second` block-times, which means the foreseen
amount of blocks in a single year is `31,536,000`, but as the network gets more decentralised block-times will grow due
to network latency, maybe raising to `5` seconds. This causes the amount of blocks in a single year to change, and hence
the amount of inflation happening each block should grow too, to follow the shift in block-times. This causes inflation to
be lower than the expected one. There's another case for which if block-times become faster, then the network will inflate
more than the expected.

Unfortunately, in order to re-adjust block provision a governance proposal is required to change the `x/mint.Params.BlocksPerYear`
parameter. Relying on governance to actively adjust the target inflation through the `BlocksPerYear` param is infeasible long
term as there can be block-time shifts as the proposal is ongoing.

Considering Archway Network relies on inflation to provide part of the inflationary rewards to developers, the rewards stream 
needs to be predictable and stable.

## Decision

We propose to create a new minting module which, instead of inflating a fixed amount each block, uses the elapsed time
between blocks to decide the amount of staking tokens that need to be minted and directed to the modules.

There's another difference between this module and the official cosmos-sdk's `x/mint`, ours should be able to correctly split
inflation across multiple modules instead of a single one.

### Params

```protobuf
syntax="proto3";

import "google/protobuf/duration.proto";

message Params {
    // min_inflation defines the network's minimum inflation.
    string min_inflation = 1; // sdk.Dec, percentage: 0 <= x <= 1
    // max_inflation defines the network's maximum inflation.
    string max_inflation = 2; // sdk.Dec, percentage: 0 <= x <= 1
    // min_bonded defines the minimum wanted bond ratio (staked supply/total supply)
    string min_bonded = 3; // sdk.Dec, percentage: 0 <= x <= 1
    
    // max_bonded defines the maximum wanted bond ratio (staked supply/total supply)
    string max_bonded = 4; // sdk.Dec, percentage: 0 <= x <= 1
    
    // inflation_change defines how much the inflation should change if
    // the bond ratio is not between the defined bands of min/max_bonded.
    // This inflation change is applied to each second for which the 
    // bond ratio was not between min_bonded and max_bonded.
    string inflation_change = 5; // sdk.Dec, percentage: 0 <= x <= 1.
    
    // max_block_duration defines the maximum duration of a block.
    // this is important to have because there can be cases for which
    // a block takes a lot longer than others, for example during upgrades.
    // In these specific cases we don't want to have bursts of inflation
    // in a single block.
    google.protobuf.Duration max_block_duration = 6;
    

    // InflationRecipient defines the inflation recipients.
    message InflationRecipient {
      // recipient is the module receiving inflation, eg: x/staking, x/rewards.
      string recipient = 1;
      // ratio is the % of inflation being received. sdk.Dec, percentage: 0 <= x <= 1.
      string ratio = 2;
    }
    
    // inflation_recipients defines the list of inflation recipients.
    // CONTRACT: the sum of the ratio of each inflation recipient must be 1.
    repeated InflationRecipient inflation_recipients = 7;
}
```

### State

The state besides `Params` is the following:

Singleton (there can exist only one value, like `Params`). 

```protobuf
syntax="proto3";

import "google/protobuf/timestamp";

// BlockInfo keeps track of the 
message LastBlockInfo {
  // inflation defines the last block's inflation.
  string inflation = 1; // sdk.Dec, percentage: 0 <= x <= 1
  // time keeps track of the last block time.  
  google.protobuf.Timestamp time = 2;
}
```

### InitGenesis


During InitGenesis, save `Params`, if `LastBlockInfo` is set then use that.

Otherwise `LastBlockInfo` becomes:

```go
LastBlockInfo{
	Inflation: Params.MinInflation,
	Time: ctx.BlockTime(),
}
```

### BeginBlock

During begin block:

```go
package mint

import "time"

const Year = 24 * time.Hour * 365

func BeginBlock(ctx sdk.Context) {
    lbi := GetLastBlockInfo(ctx)
    params := GetParams(ctx)
    timeElapsed := ctx.BlockTime().Sub(lbi.Time)
    if timeElapsed > params.MaxBlockDuration {
        timeElapsed = params.MaxBlockDuration
    }

    totalSupply := GetTotalStakingTokenSupply(ctx)
    totalBonded := GetTotalStakingTokenSupplyBonded(ctx)

    bondedRatio := totalBonded / totalSupply
    inflation := lbi.Inflation
    switch {
    case bondedRatio < params.MinBondedRatio:
        inflation += params.InflationChange * timeElapsed
    case bondedRatio > params.MaxBondedRatio:
        inflation -= params.InflationChange * timeElapsed
    }
	
	if inflation > params.MaxInflation {
		inflation = params.MaxInflation
    } else if inflation < params.MinInflation {
		inflation = params.MinInflation
    }
	

    lbi.Time = ctx.BlockTime()
    lbi.Inflation = inflation
    SetBlockInfo(ctx, lbi)

    totalCoinsToMint := (lbi.Inflation * totalSupply) * (timeElapsed/Year)
	
	for _, recp := range params.InflationRecipients {
		Mint(ctx, recp.Recipient, totalCoinsToMint * recp.Ratio)
    }
}
```

### MsgServer

No messages can be sent to this module.

### QueryServer

There are two queries, and associated CLI commands for this module:
- QueryInflation, which reports the current last block info (or maybe only the inflation).
- QueryParams, which reports the parameters.
